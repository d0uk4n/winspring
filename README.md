#Windows Respring Theme

#Install

If you are using a Rootless Jailbreak, download the arm64 deb file, if you are using a Rootfull Jailbreak, download the arm deb file, and install it using your Package manager.

Install the Snowboard tweak and the Snowboard Respring Extension tweak as an extra for it to work.

Find the Snowboard in the settings section and activate winspring and then respring. ;)
